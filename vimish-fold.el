;;; Commentary:

;; This is a package to perform text folding like in Vim.  It has the
;; following features:
;;
;; * folding of active regions;
;;
;; * good visual feedback: it's obvious which part of text is folded;
;;
;; * persistence by default: when you kill a buffer your folds don't
;;   disappear;
;;
;; * persistence scales well, you can work on hundreds of files with lots of
;;   folds without adverse effects;
;;
;; * it does not break indentation;
;;
;; * folds can be toggled from folded state to unfolded and back very
;;   easily;
;;
;; * quick navigation between existing folds;
;;
;; * you can use mouse to unfold folds (good for beginners and not only for
;;   them);
;;
;; * for fans of `avy' package: you can use `avy' to fold text with minimal
;;   number of key strokes!

`vimish-fold--save-folds'.
